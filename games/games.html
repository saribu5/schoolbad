<h1>welcome to the games directory</h1>
<p>here, you'll find games that i may or may not have programmed myself. translation: i grabbed some code off the internet and put it into my website.</p>
<br>
<br>
<a href="tetris/tetris.html">tetris</a>
<br>
<a href="snake/snake.html">snake</a>
<br>
<a href="chess2/chess2.html">chess</a>
<br>
<a href="chess/chess.html">other chess</a>
<br>
<p>chess is a more well built version of chess, taken from chessbase.com, while other chess is just a basic javascript and ai code. regardless, none of it is my own work.</p>
<br>
<p>there are still many games programmed into the website, however due to flash player shutting down, many of them do not work anymore. all games that are shown should be javascript only.</p>

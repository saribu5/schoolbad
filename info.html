  <h1>information about the website</h1>
<br>
<p1>this website was built by a random 14 year old named aaron: me. 14 as of may 2021, at least.</p1>
<br>
<br>
<p1>the purpose of this website is for him and his classmates to be able to play unblocked games while school is in session.</p1>
<br>
<br>
<p1>you may ask this: "why use this website when there are hundreds of other unblocked games websites out there?" and my answer to that question is pretty simple. you really don't need to use this website.</p1>
<br>
<br>
<p1>i created this website for mostly my own use. the games on this website are mostly games that i tend to play pretty often. </p1>
<br>
<br>
<p1>now i'll say this, which is probably the most important part of the website: i don't own any of these games. all the games on my website were taken from free, open sources like github. i don't have the programming skill to actually build any of these games, just putting them into a website.</p1>
<br>
<br>
<p1>some parts of this website are broken or misspelled or something similar. for example, in the <a href="games/tetris/tetris.html">tetris</a> page. i really don't care that it says "welocome to tetris" instead of "welcome". if it bothers you, then so be it. i don't care about my terrbile grammar, spelling, or lack of using capitalization.</p1>
<br>
<br>
<p1>if you're some random person and can't contact me in school then don't bother contacting me via my email address that is "saribu123456789@gmail.com" because you're probably some random person anyway.</p1>
<br>
<br>
<p1>this website also took heavy inspiration from a few of my friends who made a website: <a href="https://the-project.roadblk.repl.co/">the-project.</a> the website got kinda destroyed, but that website and the owner is what gave me inspiration to create this one.</p1>
